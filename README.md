This project file comprises three separate projects from my online internship.

The first assignment was developing a rudimentary chatbot utilising natural language processing ideas. For this, I use Python. I accomplished this with the NLTK library.
The second job was creating a stock portfolio tracker using statistical ideas. For this, I utilised Python. I did this with the Pandas and YFinance libraries.
The next job was to play Hangman, a game in which you guess words. For this, I utilised Python. I did this with the requests and radom libraries.
